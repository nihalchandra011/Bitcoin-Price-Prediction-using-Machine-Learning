# Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning
**Project Overview**<br>
This project aims to discover an efficient model to predict Bitcoin prices through machine learning algorithms. Specifically, it utilizes the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) module of Recurrent Neural Networks to predict the price of Bitcoin. The dataset used for this project comprises of daily Bitcoin data of the last five years obtained from CoinBase website.

**Background**<br>
Bitcoin, the first and most valuable cryptocurrency in the market, has seen highly fluctuating prices, making it difficult to predict. LSTM networks are well-suited to classify, process and make predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problems that can be encountered while training traditional RNNs. A brief perspective on Bitcoin and its economics is given in the project report to develop a better understanding on its price influencers and the general vision of this innovation.

**Methodology**<br>
The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) module of Recurrent Neural Networks is used in this project to predict the price of Bitcoin. The dataset used for this project comprises of daily Bitcoin data of the last five years obtained from CoinBase website. The usage of LSTM architecture for predicting Bitcoin prices is described with the aforementioned time series in the project report.

**Results**<br>
The results of the algorithm for predicting Bitcoin price are outlined in the form of accuracy and prediction graphs. The results predicted by the algorithm are close to the real Bitcoin prices, evident from the low Root Mean Squared Error (RSME).

**Conclusion**<br>
The results of this project demonstrate that the LSTM module of Recurrent Neural Networks is a suitable approach for predicting the prices of Bitcoin. The predicted prices are close to the real prices, as evidenced by the low RSME. This project provides a better understanding of the price influencers of Bitcoin and its general vision as an innovation.
